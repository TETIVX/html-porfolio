<h3>Night of the Living Dead (1990)</h3>
<p>Night of the living dead is a classic with all of the classic horror movie elements.</p>

<h3>Evil Dead (2013)</h3>
<p>Old school gory effects make this remake an awesome watch for Halloween. This movie does a great job of keeping the original campy feel, but ties in an internal conflict as well.</p>

<h3>The Blair Witch Project (1999)</h3>
<p>This movie is a true psychological horror masterpiece. The found-footage genre in all its glory. This is a movie that delivers for frights and feels.</p>
